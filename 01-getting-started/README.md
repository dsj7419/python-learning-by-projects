## Introduction

In this chapter, we'll begin by ensuring our Python development environment is set up correctly by writing a classic "Hello, World!" script. After that, we'll embark on a fun project to create our own Magic 8-Ball simulator!

## Environment Setup

### Installing Python

1. **Download Python:** Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python.
2. **Install Python:**
   - **Windows/Mac:** Open the installer and ensure that you select the ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù option before installing.
   - **Linux:** Use your package manager. For Ubuntu, you can use: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3`.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

Virtual environments are a best practice for Python development, allowing you to create isolated spaces for your project‚Äôs dependencies, avoiding conflicts between projects and system-wide packages.

1. **Install virtualenv:**
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   Navigate to your project directory and run:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
   Replace `myenv` with your preferred environment name.
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - **Windows:** `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   - **Mac/Linux:** `source myenv/bin/activate`

### Installing an IDE

We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for Python development:

1. **Download and Install:** Visit the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to download and install it.
2. **Install Python Extension:** Open VSCode, visit the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for "Python", and install it.

## Your First Python Script: Hello, World!

1. **Create a File:** In your project directory, create a new file named `hello_world.py`.
2. **Write Code:** Open `hello_world.py` in your IDE and write the following code:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
3. **Save the File:** Ensure that your script is saved.
4. **Run the Script:** Open your terminal, navigate to the script‚Äôs directory, and run:
   ```bash
   python hello_world.py
   ```
   You should see `Hello, World!` printed in the terminal.

## Project: Magic 8-Ball Simulator (WORK IN PROGRESS)

### Objective

Create a simple Python script that simulates a Magic 8-Ball. The user will ask a yes-or-no question, and the program will respond with a random answer.

### Requirements

- Prompt the user for input.
- Ensure the input ends with a question mark.
- Randomly select an answer from a predefined list.
- Display the answer.

### Guidance

1. **User Input:** Utilize `input()` to get the user's question.
2. **Random Selection:** Use the `random` module to randomly select an answer.
3. **Output:** Utilize `print()` to display the selected answer.
4. **Validation:** Ensure the input is a question.

Feel free to refer to the code skeleton provided in the chapter's `/code/` folder to get started! (WORK IN PROGRESS)

## Quiz

Stay tuned! We'll be adding a quiz here to test your knowledge and understanding of the concepts learned in this chapter.
