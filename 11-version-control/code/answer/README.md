# Collaborative Document Editor

## Objective

In this project, our goal is to create a collaborative environment where multiple developers can work together on a document editor using Git and GitHub. The document editor itself is a simple Python application, but the crux of this project is understanding the Git workflow, collaborating on GitHub, and managing a multi-developer project.

## Setting Up the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    - Download the Python code for the document editor from the `/code/` folder in this chapter.
    - Create a new repository on GitHub and push the code to the GitHub repository.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
    - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your projects to manage dependencies. 
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```
    - Activate the virtual environment.
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Necessary Dependencies:**
    - If the project requires any external libraries, ensure they are installed and possibly create a requirements.txt file to keep track of these dependencies.

4. **Run the Code:**
    - Ensure the code runs correctly and familiarize yourself with the application.
    ```bash
    python document_editor.py
    ```

## Collaborative Development Workflow

### Working with Branches

One of the key concepts of Git is its use of branches which allows developers to work on different tasks/features in isolation and integrate changes smoothly back into the main code base. Here’s a simplified workflow:

1. **Creating a New Branch:**
    - Before working on a new feature or bug, create a new branch.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b [branch-name]
    ```
   
2. **Working on the Branch:**
    - Make your changes, commit them to your branch providing meaningful commit messages.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "[Your detailed commit message]"
    ```

3. **Pushing Changes:**
    - Push your changes to GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin [branch-name]
    ```

4. **Pull Request (PR):**
    - On GitHub, create a pull request for your branch. Request your teammates to review your code and once it's approved, merge it into the `main` branch.

5. **Keep Synced:**
    - Regularly pull changes from the `main` branch to stay synced with the team’s progress.
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

### Issue Tracking and Discussions

Utilize GitHub's Issues and Discussions features to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and general discussions related to the project. Organize tasks, assign developers to specific issues, and ensure a smooth and collaborative development process.

### Code Reviews

Engage in code review practices to maintain code quality and consistency. Provide constructive feedback, suggest improvements, and ensure that merged code is of high quality and bug-free as possible.

### Merging and Conflict Resolution

Learn and practice resolving merge conflicts. Work on understanding Git's merging mechanism and how to manually resolve conflicts when they arise.

## Conclusion

This project is a simulation of real-world collaborative development. Utilize this safe space to make mistakes, learn from them, and understand the nuances of collaborative coding, which is a critical skill in the industry.

Feel free to take creative liberties, propose new features, refactor the code, and ensure that you are not only coding but also communicating and collaborating effectively with your team.

Remember: The objective is not just to write code, but to work together effectively as a team. Happy coding!
