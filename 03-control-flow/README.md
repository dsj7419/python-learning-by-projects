## Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 3: Control Flow! ðŸš€ In this chapter, we embark on a journey through the logical constructs that give our programs decision-making abilities. We'll delve deep into conditionals and loops, creating a pathway for writing dynamic and interactive Python scripts. Get ready to build an engaging "Adventure Game" that provides a vibrant, user-driven experience!

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Conditionals
#### Understanding `if`, `elif`, and `else`
Conditionals are foundational blocks in Python that facilitate decision-making. An `if` statement checks a condition: if the condition is `True`, the code within the block is executed. Optionally, `elif` and `else` can be used to handle alternative outcomes.

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

**Why Conditionals?** They allow our code to exhibit different behaviors based on certain conditions, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability to various scenarios.

#### Logical Operators
Logical operators, namely `and`, `or`, and `not`, enable us to create compound conditional statements, enriching our ability to express logical flows accurately.

```python
is_weekday = True
is_holiday = False
if is_weekday and not is_holiday:
    print("Time to work!")
```

**Importance:** Logical operators empower our conditionals, allowing us to craft more sophisticated and precise logical paths in our code.

### 2. Loops
#### Looping with `for`
A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), executing a block of code for each element in the sequence.

```python
for fruit in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']:
    print(fruit)
```

**Benefit:** `for` loops allow us to automate repetitive tasks, making our code more efficient and concise.

#### Looping with `while`
A `while` loop perpetually executes a block of code as long as the specified condition remains `True`. Be cautious to avoid infinite loops!

```python
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
```

**Usage:** `while` loops are excellent when the number of iterations is unknown or contingent on dynamic conditions.

#### Controlling Loop Execution
- `break`: Prematurely exits the loop, halting further iterations.
- `continue`: Bypasses the remainder of the loop's code block and proceeds to the next iteration.

```python
for number in range(10):
    if number == 5:
        break  # Stops the loop when number equals 5
    elif number % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skips even numbers
    print(number)
```

**Practicality:** Control statements like `break` and `continue` offer us greater control over loop execution, enabling us to manage iterations effectively.

### Bringing It All Together: Mini-Example
Imagine a simple quiz game that asks the user to guess a number and informs them if they are correct.

```python
correct_answer = 3
user_answer = int(input("Guess the number (1-5): "))

if user_answer == correct_answer:
    print("Congratulations! You guessed it right.")
else:
    print("Oops! Better luck next time.")
```

### Key Takeaways
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`) enable decision-making.
- Loops (`for`, `while`) allow code to be repeated.
- Logical operators and loop control statements (`break`, `continue`) further manage control flow.

## Project: Adventure Game

### Objective

Construct an interactive, text-based adventure game where the user navigates through different scenarios by making choices.

### Requirements

- Provide the user with a series of choices.
- Use conditionals to determine the path the user takes through the game.
- Utilize loops to allow continuous gameplay until a termination condition is met.
- Ensure clear instructions and feedback for the user.

### Guidance

1. **Designing Scenarios:** Create various scenarios that the user will navigate through, each with its own choices and outcomes.
2. **User Choices:** Use `input()` to get choices from the user.
3. **Game Logic:** Implement conditionals and loops to control game flow and player progression.

## Quiz
