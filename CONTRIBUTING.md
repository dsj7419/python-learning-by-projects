# Contributing to Project-Based Python Learning Course

👍🎉 First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Project-Based Python Learning Course, hosted by [dsj7419](https://github.com/dsj7419) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Python Learning Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [dsj7419](https://github.com/dsj7419).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dsj7419/python-learning-by-projects/issues).
  
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/dsj7419/python-learning-by-projects/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](https://github.com/dsj7419/python-learning-by-projects)**.
  
- **Perform a cursory search** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Pull Requests

- **Choose an appropriate branch** for your pull request.
  
- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the pull request and commits.

- **Include any relevant issue numbers** in the PR body, not the title.

- **Provide a comprehensive description** of the proposed changes.

- **Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)**.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
  
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").

- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    - 🎨 (`:art:`) when improving the format/structure of the code.
    - 🐎 (`:racehorse:`) when improving performance.
    - 📝 (`:memo:`) when writing docs.
    - 🐛 (`:bug:`) when fixing a bug.
    - 🚑 (`:ambulance:`) when fixing a critical bug.
    - ✨ (`:sparkles:`) when introducing new features.
    - 📦 (`:package:`) when pushing new releases.
    - ... etc: see [this guide](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) for other emojis.

### Python Styleguide

Follow the [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide for Python code.
